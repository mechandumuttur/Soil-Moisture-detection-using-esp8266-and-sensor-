Soil Moisture Detection using ESP8266 is a cost-effective and reliable method for monitoring soil moisture levels. By utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller, it is possible to gather real-time data on soil moisture levels and transmit that information to a server or database for analysis.
The advantages of this approach include low cost, ease of use, and the ability to remotely monitor soil moisture levels. Additionally, the system can be customized to meet specific needs, such as adjusting the sensitivity of the moisture sensors or configuring alerts for certain moisture levels.
